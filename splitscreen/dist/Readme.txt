Games That allow disabling of controller support work well with games that don't.
(Preventing both games from using the same HID at the same time)
Hopefully in future updates the app will be able to bypass this issue.
listed below are tested games and combos.

Games with support(no HID conflictions)
	Schedule 1, Battlefield 2042
	Schedule 1, Gears 5
	Schedule 1, Titan fall 2(buggy input lag with mouse in schedule 1(both steam controller inputs need to be disabled)
