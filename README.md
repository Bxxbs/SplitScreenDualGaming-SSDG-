Intro:

                                                                  Welcome to SplitScreen Dual Gaming.

This Applacation is for people who want to split screen two games(or more) and play with two people(or more).
Currently this version is able two play two games simultaneously one with keyboard one with controller.
Currentlly this is an exe applacation that was converted from python, I will also add the python(.py) file for people on linux and a proper installation to use.
I have tested a few combonations like bioshock and gears and it works fine as long as you disable controller in bioshock settings.

Potential issues:

Due to the nature of this applacations make sure your computer can handle two games at once.
This applacation can cause exessive heat especially with two games running on high settings.
Worst that has happened in my personal testing is crashing and restarting or hanging and needing to be restarted; however,
I do notice some games like gears and battlefield making cpu and gpu hit 90 if fan curves and cooling arent optimal.
Also if both games detect the controller there will be HID conflictions(I'm still trying to find a way, hidhide didn't work.)

Installation(Windows):

1. Place the folder somewhere on your computer
2. Go into dist and create a split.exe shortcut.
3. Place it on desktop and start.

Usage:
1.  Start two games make sure they both are in window mode in the setting and one of the games has controller disabled(if it even supports or detects it in settings or steam.)
2.  once both are started go back to your explorer screen and run the split.exe on desktop.
3.  Follow the instructions pick the games and style of split and enjoy.
Note:  Sometimes the game that uses keyboard needs to be clicked on for focus but both games should work.
